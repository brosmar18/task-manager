# Task Manager
This is a simple Task Manager application built with Python 3 and Tkinter. The application allows users to add, delete, and complete tasks.

## Installation
To run the application, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. If you don't have Python 3 installed, you can download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python 3 installed, clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:


`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To run the application, navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:


`python task-manager`

The Task Manager window should open up. To add a task, type the task in the input box and click the "Add task" button. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task. To mark a task as completed, click the checkbox next to the task.

The application saves tasks to a text file named "data/tasks.txt". Each task is marked with a status: Loaded, Added, Completed, or Deleted.

## Future Improvements
- Add the ability to edit tasks
